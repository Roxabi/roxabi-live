"""Tests for roxabi_live.corpus.schema — SQLite corpus DB bootstrap.

Tests verify that:
- bootstrap() is idempotent (safe to call twice on the same path).
- All expected tables and indexes are created: issues, labels, edges,
  sync_state, and the ix_edges_dst index.
- The issues table does NOT contain body or body_hash columns (explicitly
  excluded per spec to keep the corpus lean).

RED state: scripts/corpus/schema.py does not exist yet.  All tests will
fail with ModuleNotFoundError until the implementation lands in T2.
